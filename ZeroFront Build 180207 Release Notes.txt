* For advanced SWBF modders only

I first started working on ZeroFront in 2014 with my "BF2 to BF1 stock maps shell mod" ideas thread on SWBFModders. Build 180207 improves the stock Core.lvl, Mission.lvl, and Shell.lvl for new stock map support. New custom Load.lvl builds and custom voiceovers are pending a future update. You can either download the installer, or the manual patch files. Make sure the new maps go here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\LucasArts\Star Wars Battlefront\GameData\Data\_LVL_PC\ZERO

I've added 12 new maps from stock BFII to SWBF. These no longer use AddOn and are considered base game maps. Players who install this patch can safely remove these maps from their AddOn folder, since they're obsolete and incompatible online. I've added them to the default Clone Wars and Galactic Civil Wars Campaign too as extensions for the regular game campaigns, which are now both twice as long as before! Also Kamino, Geonosis, Endor, and Hoth now support both GCW and CW eras for each map. 

All of these maps were ported by Phobos, BattleBelk, Rebel Scum, and Imperial Strikeforce. Here is the new missionlist: 
Coruscant: Jedi Temple - Phobos
Dagobah: Swamp - Phobos
Death Star: Interior - Phobos
Felucia: Marshland - Phobos
Geonosis: Dust Plains - Phobos
Kamino: Cloning Facility - Phobos
Kashyyyk: BeachHead - Phobos
Mustafar: Refinery - Rebel Scum & Imp Strikeforce
Mygeeto: War-Torn City - Rebel Scum & Imp Strikeforce
Polis Massa: Medical Facility - BattleBelk
Tantive IV: Interior - Phobos
Utapau: Sinkhole -  Phobos

12 additional mod maps for BF1 have also been added. Currently these are:
Coruscant: City - Rends
Coruscant: Streets - Rends
Dantooine: Dust - Eddie
Dantooine: Outpost - Ginev
Earth: Egypt - Yoda The Froggy
Earth: Russia - Yoda The Froggy
Felucia: Forest - Phobos
Hoth: Caves - Yoda The Froggy
Naboo: Prototype - Psych0fred
Ord Mantel: No Greater Glory - Rippentuck
Rhen Var: Bridge - NewGuy99
Tranquaan: Tech Center - Skyhammer_216

In addition to 16 stock BF1 maps such as Rhen Var: Citadel, all 12 stock BF2 maps excluding space maps (for now), and several converted mod maps (currently 12), Star Wars ZeroFront now features a total of 40 stock classical maps! 

Only Tatooine: Jabba's Palace remains in the AddOn, this frees up the AddOn folder for several custom mod maps. All of The Walking Dead Battlefront maps (as of v0.97) are also supported by default in the game shell for ZeroFront. The 1.2 game engine supports hundreds of stock maps, but only 24 mod maps, so expect to see more maps converted in future ZeroFront updates. 

Our SWBFSpy servers will be hosting the new stock maps for all PC community players. Thanks to the www.SWBFModders.com community for keeping Star Wars Battlefront alive with new amazing releases!
