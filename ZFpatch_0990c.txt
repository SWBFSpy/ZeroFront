https://github.com/SWBFSpy/ZeroFront/blob/master/ZFpatch_0990c.txt

Note: The "c" patch couldn't be uploaded to GitHub due to containing modified exe. The only official download links for it are from MediaFire, Mega, SWBFSpy and SWBFModders. These four websites shall contain the latest cutting edge patch files for ZeroFront.

Every ZF patch between v0.990 and v1.0 uses v0.990 [5GB] as a base, and players only need the most recent addon patch instead of any previous ones. So, if you downloaded v0.990 and then the v0.990c patch, you do NOT need the "a" or "b" patch, as those files are included with the "c" patch except where superseded. And again when the v0.991 patch drops, you only need that + the v0.990 base files. Addons for v0.990 will be released up until v0.999z. Only when ZeroFront v1.0 is released must players re-download the entire game.

Instructions: To install, first extract "ZeroFront_v0.990" to "C:\ZeroFront", and then extract "ZFpatch_0990c.7z" to "C:\ZeroFront", say yes to overwrite files. (If you have Gold Edition then extract that right before 0.990c)

Patch Notes:
1. Bornesia: Valley crashing patched by editing the bor1_conquest.lyr to replace all 30 instances of "bor_bldg_railgun" with "com_weap_gunturret"
2. Quinlan Vos rebalanced with mynnic2.odf called upon for MYN LUA (Mynnic is stronger for AWC campaign, with Vos now the same strength as Obi-Wan)
3. Force Push removed from all jedi/sith except Yoda, Mace, Oppo, Plagueis, Sidious and Binks (Luke Skywalker given Chaingun, other units given pistol)
4. Count Dooku's pistol swapped with Force Lightning
5. All JetJumps (except for Yoda and Maw) set to 16, with Mace, Oppo, Plagueis, Sidious, Binks, Maul and Greivous set to 21
6. Yoda, Maw, Maul and Greivous have fall damage removed
7. Included expanded sound memorypool instructions for SPTest, Steam, GOG, and Classic Collection executable versions
8. Added 010 Editor Scripts (modding tool) by BattleBelk
9. Increased Desann size to Wookiee and Greivous skeleton scale of 1.15
10. Patched dro1a_h by changing "sith_maw" typo to "geo_inf_maw"
11. Added Oppo Rancisis to JEDI.lvl and swapped Kyle Katarn on exe0a_h with Oppo Rancisis
12. Added C-3PO Battledroid to SITH.lvl and to the following scripts: eli1c_h, cor1c_h, dro1a_h, bez0a, tau0a, coo1a_h, exe0a and exe0a_h
13. Updated health values accordingly: Plagueis/Binks/Sidious/Yoda/Oppo/Mace=2000, Desann/Vader/Kylo/Rey/Luke/Obiwan/Greivous/Maul/Quinlan/Dooku/C-3PO=1500, Asajj/Quigon/Jerec/Maw/Kit/Kiadi/Ahsoka/Kyle=1000

17. Disabled NoEnterVehicles for jedi/sith/mace/mon/myn odfs

[b]Credit Updates[/b]
- Cerea: Savage Hunt - AgentSmith_27 & Phobos
- C-3PO - Napseeker & Phobos
- Oppo Rancisis - Deviss
- Darth Plagueis - Wazmol
- General Greivous - Napseeker & Pandemic

Phobos: This is basically the idea for the ZeroFront First Order Campaign rewrite of Episodes 7-9. Yoda still dies at the end of ROTJ/GCW but so does Sidious. The Jedi Council is reborn with Oppo Rancisis as the Grand Master, and Luke Skywalker as Master of the Order. Rey Skywalker joins the council, along with Coleman Kcaj (as a Rakata instead of Ongree), Ahsoka Tano, Kyle Katarn, Quinlan Vos, Cilghal, K'Kruhk and Mara Jade. Plagueis and Binks reveal themselves as the top sith lords, recruiting Kylo Ren and Asajj Ventress as acolytes. C-3PO works as a rogue agent similar to 8t88, but develops force powers and uses a yellow lightsaber.

    I increased the maximum possible memory pool allocated by the game for sounds from 32 megabytes to 256.
    Current Instruction:
    1. Using HexEditor, navigate to address "95AD"
    2. Сhange the code from "00 02 E8" to "00 16 E8"
    3. Navigate to address "9755"
    4. Сhange the code from "00 02 C7 05 38 52 CD 01 80 00 00" to "00 16 C7 05 38 52 CD 01 00 04 00"
    5. Now you can use as many sounds as you need for every map

    Instruction for SPTest:
    1. Using HexEditor, navigate to address "1C96D7"
    2. Сhange the code from "00 02 E8" to "00 16 E8"

    SPTest will show more than 300 megabytes because of one problem (which I'm too lazy to look up how to solve), but it should actually be 256.

    Instruction for Steam version:
    1. Using HexEditor, navigate to address "30D527"
    2. Сhange the code from "00 02 E8" to "00 16 E8"

    Instruction for Gog version:
    1. Using HexEditor, navigate to address "306D87"
    2. Сhange the code from "00 02 E8" to "00 16 E8"
    3. Navigate to address "306F24"
    4. Сhange the code from "68 80 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 02 FF" to "68 00 08 00 00 68 00 00 00 16 FF"

    2. Сhange the code from "00 02 FF" to "00 16 FF"
    3. Navigate to address "314AA0"
    4. Сhange the code from "B9 80 00 00 00 48 89 44 24 20 41 B8 00 00 00 02 48" to "B9 00 08 00 00 48 89 44 24 20 41 B8 00 00 00 16 48"[/quote]

[b]ZeroFront v0.990a Patch - September 21st 2024[/b]
I forgot to disable lightsaber deflect for some of the new heroes, so I've added a quick fix for this.
No time to recompress everything, just extract the patch 7z (after installing ZeroFront) to overwrite Mace, Jedi and Sith files here
