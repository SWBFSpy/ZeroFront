# ZeroFront
Updates to ZeroEngine and Star Wars Battlefront game files

A project by SWBFSpy Founder | Phobos [FC] and other active members of the www.SWBFModders.com community to update Star Wars Battlefront (2004) with improved game files and new features such as increased memorypools, unlocked client/server mod limits, and multiplayer support for custom Galactic Conquests.

Some of our files can't be distributed on GitHub for various reasons explained on our website, but the Release Notes for each new ZeroFront Build will usually be posted here, with links to our forum, where SWBF community players can download the latest updates.
