# ZeroFront
Updates to ZeroEngine and Star Wars Battlefront game files

Latest Version: 200223 (v0.972)
-
A project by SWBFSpy Founder | Phobos [FC] and other active members of the www.SWBFModders.com community to update Star Wars Battlefront (2004) with improved game files and new features such as increased memorypools, unlocked client/server mod limits, and multiplayer support for custom Galactic Conquests. We're also reversing the game source using assembly to surpass the hard-coded limits of ZeroEngine and implement support for deep reinforcement learning, since Pandemic said they can't release the Battlefront Zero source code. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(game_engine)

ZeroFront Builds are released as an autoinstaller, like TWD Battlefront, to add or replace specific game files. Battlefront executable is more difficult to modify than .LVL files, but it offers the most modding potential. One day, our community will have cracked everything in the game! Some of our files can't be distributed on GitHub for various reasons explained on our website, but the Release Notes for each new ZeroFront Build are posted here, with links to our forum, where SWBF community players can download the latest updates. Several of our ideas and creations can be applied to other games too.

New mods, maps, and other tools are being added such as the SWBFSpyAdmin and Server Browser. ZeroFront also includes patched client/server files for SWBFSpy support, which are continually updated with each new build. The public SWBFSpy patch has been updated as of May 2019 to be compatible with Steam, see these links for more info:

Models
-
ZeroFront aims to increase the modding limits of MSH files in ZeroEngine, the game engine used by Pandemic Studios for Star Wars Battlefront (2004). Support for higher collision model memorypools is one of our goals, along with features such as model swapping in-game. 

Riley outlined a lot of info I used when writing my tutorial. The .MSH format was originally created from .RIFF format, see this link for more information: https://swbfmodders.com/index.php?topic=238.0

Without our community tutorials, this project would not exist. Special thank you to Phobos on swbfmodders.com for his inventions, discoveries, tutorials, mod tools, servers, master server, and awesome new game expansions!

**What is ZeroFront?**
-
ZeroFront is the ultimate expansion patch for Star Wars Battlefront (2004). Featuring the SWBFspy multiplayer patch which replaces the now-defunct GameSpy, and countless major mod innovations, the SWBFModders community has made the greatest contributions ever for this awesome game, and we're continuing to keep it alive well into the 2020s and beyond. Last year we finished adding leaderboards support for the master server, and we continue to support game servers for SWBF1 and SWBF2 on both PC and PS2 platforms. This year there are several new hacks and mods being implemented for ZeroEngine (the game EXE), ZeroFront (the expansion mod/hack project), and ZeroBuilder (all the community resources and mod tools used to build ZF). ZeroFront itself features major expansions such as:
- Improvements to all stock side files, missions, maps, and other game files with tactical and aesthetic improvements.
- Extensions to the stock 2 era/campaigns (CW and GCW) with new missions, maps, briefings, videos, sounds, weapons, units, vehicles, etc.
- 3 new eras with corresponding custom campaigns: Alien Wars, DiabloFront, and Walking Dead. AW features extended universe battles such as Mynnic, Jedi vs Sith, Darth Binks, and more. DBF features magic, demons, underground catacombs, battles in hell, roman colosseum fights, medieval castle sieges, and much more. TWD is a unique remix of the comic and TV universe blended with other zombie ideas, with a custom campaign and other various modes, it's the most comprehensive era, with thousands of new features never seen before in SWBF.
- Additional custom campaigns that don't have custom eras such as: DarkTrooper Boot Camp for GCW shotgun units, Jet Wars Campaign featuring mixed GCW/CW battles, and Invisibles Training Academy (ITA) the ultimate skill improvement campaign. This also features brand new combat modes such as the TWD666 prototype.
- Implementation of removed features such as game modes, maps, units, weapons, etc. from BF2 and design documents.
- Memory hacks and various mod-hacking tools for the game engine used in combination with custom mods (such as togglers) to improve the replayability and unlock limitations.
- Complete replacement for GameSpy multiplayer with SWBFSpy.org master server, leaderboards, PC/PS2 support, with modding and technical support community of SWBFModders.
- SWBF community events and tournaments for ZeroFront mods featuring players, enhanced modded AI, and eventually neural networks.
- Improvements to the ZeroBuilder assets, tutorials, and modding tools used by the SWBFModders community.
- Support for Steam to optionally be used in conjunction with ZeroFront and SWBFSpy.

**Main Features of ZeroFront**
-
- All kinds of improvements to the game engine to the extent that is currently possible.
- Continued improvement to our SWBFSpy master servers, game servers, mods, and websites.
- Improvements to the GUI and all other game files including tactical client mod enhancements of all kinds (togglers, crosshairs, moon map skins, etc.)
- Custom shell missionlist script that adds a maximum of 255 stock maps to the game, compared to what shipped by default in version 1.2 (only 16 maps + Jabba's Palace).
- Improvements to all the 17 classic stock maps, for improved AI pathing, hintnodes, death regions, and bugfixes for other map elements.
- Optional pack for all of Phobos' tactical boost mods, such as crosshair/skin changers, pausemenu togglers, higher framerates, lunar ice reskins of various stock maps, and other buffs to stock LVLs.
- All SWBF2 maps ported to BF1 stock shell such as Coruscant, Dagobah, Death Star, Felucia, Geonosis, Hoth, Kamino, Mustafar, Mygeeto, Polis Massa, Utapau, and the space maps.
- Excluded prototype maps from Pandemic, which are being restored and improved by Phobos such as: Naboo Prototype, Geonosis Prototype, and ChainIsle.
- Excluded ideas for maps in the original SWBF Game Design Document, for planets such as Thyferra, Kessel, Korriban, Ossus, Despayre Station, Raxus Prime, Corellia, Mon Calamari, Alderaan, & Bakura.
- Tons of custom maps created by Phobos, most of which are built specifically for Alien Wars and Walking Dead eras. 
- Also some restored older mod maps from previous modders who gave us their permission, such as Eddie and Rends.
- Extended Stock Campaigns for Galactic Civil War and Clone Wars. From only 7 maps now to 50 missions each, with new voiceovers!
- Extended spawn menu for all missions in the game, for 10v10 units in team select, or 11v11 in auto assign servers. The game only allows 5v5 by default.
- 5 Factions instead of only 2, so in addition to GCW and Clone Wars, there is now Alien Wars, DiabloFront, and Walking Dead era! All five factions will have 11v11 units each + support for all 250 new maps!
- 5-10 Campaigns instead of only 2. The Walking Dead Campaign already has Seasons 1-4 finished, with outlines for Season 5-10 and beyond! Alien Wars Campaign has outline too, along with DiabloFront. Updated campaigns such as Boot Camp and Invisibles Training Academy featured too.
- Cross-era battles supported too for instant deathmatch mode. Also new expanded game modes such as Skirmish, Assault, Capture The Flag are also being added using Phobos' workaround method for modded 1-flag support.
- For now the 10v10 units are fairsides (ICW7 style), such as Empire + Rebel vs Rebel + Empire (same for other eras), with heroes playable in 11v11 auto assign. For final ZeroFront version, each faction will instead be expanded to feature 11 unique units each!
- Much more that will be added to this over time, and some other unique ideas only mentioned on our private advanced SWBFmodders board.
- ZeroFront when finished will have all assets, builders, and tutorials used to create this massive mod released for our community as the ultimate improved ZeroBuilder Mod Tools!
- Regarding our SWBFSpy MP servers, there is still a limit of only ~25 maps per server session. We can host around 250 unique maps at once on our own 10 official game servers, with support for dozens of game servers! This is why I've broken up our game servers into main categories as explained in the SWBFSpy tutorial.
