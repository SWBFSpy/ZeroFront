# ZeroFront
Updates to ZeroEngine and Star Wars Battlefront game files

A project by SWBFSpy Founder | Phobos [FC] and other active members of the www.SWBFModders.com community to update Star Wars Battlefront (2004) with improved game files and new features such as increased memorypools, unlocked client/server mod limits, and multiplayer support for custom Galactic Conquests. We're also reversing the game source using assembly to surpass the hard-coded limits of ZeroEngine and implement support for deep reinforcement learning, since Pandemic said they can't release the Battlefront Zero source code. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_(game_engine)

ZeroFront Builds are released as an autoinstaller, like TWD Battlefront, to add or replace specific game files. Battlefront executable is more difficult to modify than .LVL files, but it offers the most modding potential. One day, our community will have cracked everything in the game! Some of our files can't be distributed on GitHub for various reasons explained on our website, but the Release Notes for each new ZeroFront Build are posted here, with links to our forum, where SWBF community players can download the latest updates. Several of our ideas and creations can be applied to other games too.

New mods, maps, and other tools are being added such as the SWBFSpyAdmin and Server Browser. ZeroFront also includes patched client/server files for SWBFSpy support, which are continually updated with each new build. The public patch however, is no longer updated since July 2017: http://info.swbfspy.org/SWBFSpyPatch.7z
